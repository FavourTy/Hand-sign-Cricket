# 🏏 Hand Sign Cricket  v1.2.0  


## 📌 Description  
Remember our childhood when we played **Odd/Even** to decide the toss and proceeded to play **Hand Sign Cricket**? If the same hand signs appeared, the batter was out; otherwise, the game continued. 🤩  

I have taken this nostalgic game further and turned it into **Hand Sign Cricket**, now coded into a playable digital version. 🚀
